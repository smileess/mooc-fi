Complete solution set to the University of Helsinki's object-oriented programming in Java.

A lot of these solutions were implemented when I was first learning Java and may not be optimal.
However, I am keeping them as is in order to track my progress as I keep improving my skills.

This course was an excellent introduction to Java programming, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn
Java or object-oriented programming. If you want to take this course, go to <http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/>.
